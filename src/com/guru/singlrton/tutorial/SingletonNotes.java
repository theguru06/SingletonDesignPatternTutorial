/*
 * Definition:
 * "Singleton Design Pattern : Ensure that a class has only one instance and a global point of 
 * access to it."
 * 
 * Implementation: 
 * Make sure only one instance : restrict construction -private constructor
 * provide a global point of access - static method to get sole instance
 * 
 *   Why Hard to implement/break singleton:
 *   >Reflection	
 *   >Clone
 *   >Serialization/Deserialization
 *   >multi-threaded access
 *   >multiple class loader
 *   >garbage collection -[till java 1.0]
